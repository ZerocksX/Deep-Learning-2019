EMPEROR:
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.

VADER:
I have felt it.

EMPEROR:
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.

VADER:
What is thy bidding, My Master?

HAN:
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.

RIEEKAN:
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.

HAN:
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.

RIEEKAN:
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.

HAN:
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.

RIEEKAN:
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.

HAN:
That's right.

HAN:
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.

RIEEKAN:
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

HAN:
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.

RIEEKAN:
Good, and Commander Skywalker?

HAN:
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.

RIEEKAN:
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?

HAN:
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.

THREEPIO:
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.

HAN:
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...

THREEPIO:
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...

HAN:
I'm going to see what it is.

THREEPIO:
It sounds like it's trying to get in.

THREEPIO:
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.

HAN:
You, too, golden rod.

THREEPIO:
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?

HAN:
What are you so grouchy about?

HAN:
We're in trouble!

THREEPIO:
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para light system seems to be damaged.

HAN:
I think we're in trouble.

THREEPIO:
It can wait.

HAN:
Sit down, and shut up!

THREEPIO:
Sir, I was wondering ...

THREEPIO:
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.

HAN:
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!

HAN:
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.

THREEPIO:
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...

HAN:
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.

HAN:
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.

THREEPIO:
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?

THREEPIO:
She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...

HAN:
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?

THREEPIO:
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.

HAN:
What is it?

THREEPIO:
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?

HAN:
... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...

LEIA:
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.

HAN:
Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.

LEIA:
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.

HAN:
I was worried about you.

HAN:
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...

LEIA:
No thanks.

LEIA:
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?

HAN:
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.

LEIA:
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.

HAN:
He found him in a junk pile ...

HAN:
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.

LEIA:
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.

HAN:
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.

LEIA:
Has Threepio turned up yet?

HAN:
You look great.

LEIA:
You look silly.

HAN:
Who's staring?

LEIA:
What are you staring at?

HAN:
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.

LEIA:
I don't like this.

HAN:
Let er go, Chewie.

LEIA:
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.

HAN:
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...

LEIA:
Can you trust him?

HAN:
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.

LEIA:
A mining colony.

HAN:
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, conartist ... all around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.

LEIA:
Never heard of that system.

HAN:
Well, sometimes ... Ahhah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.

LEIA:
You keep logs?  My, how organized.

HAN:
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.

HAN:
Here ... near the Anoat system.

LEIA:
That depends.  Where are we?

HAN:
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?

LEIA:
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?

HAN:
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.

LEIA:
What'd you have in mind for your next move?

HAN:
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.

LEIA:
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.

HAN:
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?

LEIA:
You could have warned him before you shut him off.

LEIA:
You're going to attack them?!!!

HAN:
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.

HAN:
It's not my fault.  I can't under stand it!

LEIA:
No lightspeed?

HAN:
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.

LEIA:
The entrance is collapsing!

HAN:
I see it Chewie, hang on.

LEIA:
But the tremors have stopped.

HAN:
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!

LEIA:
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.

HAN:
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.

LEIA:
Looks like some kind of Mynock.

HAN:
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...

LEIA:
Are you crazy!

LEIA:
Outside, in the cave.

HAN:
Where?

LEIA:
There's something out there!

HAN:
Try and control this ...

LEIA:
I do not!

HAN:
You mean a man you can control.

LEIA:
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.

HAN:
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.

LEIA:
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.

LEIA:
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.

HAN:
What are you afraid of?

HAN:
Why?

LEIA:
Stop that.

HAN:
That's quite a compliment.

LEIA:
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

HAN:
You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.

LEIA:
Yes, you do.

HAN:
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.

LEIA:
Would you please stop calling me that?

HAN:
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.

LEIA:
Where have I heard that before?

HAN:
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.

LEIA:
They're moving away.

LEIA:
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.

HAN:
That was no earthquake.

HAN:
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.

LEIA:
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.

HAN:
Well, I hope you don't expect more.

LEIA:
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.

HAN:
Beautiful.

LEIA:
How do I look?

HAN:
You don't look angry.

LEIA:
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.

HAN:
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.

HAN:
That should do nicely.

LEIA:
What is it?

HAN:
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.

HAN:
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...

LEIA:
Now you're making sense.

HAN:
We've got to get out of this shower.

LEIA:
I'm against that.

HAN:
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.

LEIA:
Good.

HAN:
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.

LEIA:
I take it back.

HAN:
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.

HAN:
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.

LEIA:
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?

HAN:
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.

LEIA:
Probably an asteroid field ....

HAN:
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...

LEIA:
Or you ran into something ....

HAN:
That was no laser blast .... some thing hit us ....

LEIA:
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.

HAN:
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.

HAN:
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?

LEIA:
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.

HAN:
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.

LEIA:
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.

HAN:
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.

LEIA:
Would it help if I got out and pushed?

LEIA:
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.

HAN:
Hey!  Someone's still in here.

HAN:
Who's scruffylooking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?

LEIA:
Why you lowdown, stuckup, half witted, scruffylooking nerfherder.

HAN:
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?

LEIA:
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.

HAN:
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.

LEIA:
I don't know what he's talking about.

LEIA:
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.

HAN:
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.

HAN:
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.

LEIA:
An Imperial probe droid.

HAN:
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a selfdestruct ....

LEIA:
What was it?

HAN:
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.

HAN:
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.

LEIA:
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.

HAN:
Forget it.

LEIA:
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...

HAN:
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.

LEIA:
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?

HAN:
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.

LEIA:
We are fighting for a cause much ...

HAN:
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.

LEIA:
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.

HAN:
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.

LEIA:
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.

HAN:
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.

LEIA:
And what are they, pray tell?

HAN:
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...

LEIA:
Me?  I don't know what you mean.

HAN:
Not you?

LEIA:
Yes.

HAN:
We?

LEIA:
Han, we need you here.

HAN:
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.

LEIA:
Does Luke know?

HAN:
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.

LEIA:
You said you were going to stay. What happened?

HAN:
Yes, Your Highness?

HAN:
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.

LUKE:
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.

HAN:
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.

LUKE:
About what?

HAN:
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.

LUKE:
Probe?  What probe?

HAN:
That's two you owe me, junior.

LUKE:
Thanks to you.

HAN:
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.

LUKE:
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.

HAN:
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.

LUKE:
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read ings.

HAN:
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

HAN:
Yeah, you're a real hero.

LANDO:
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...

LANDO:
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.

HAN:
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?

HAN:
Luke?  I don't get it.

LANDO:
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.

HAN:
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.

LANDO:
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.

HAN:
This ought to be good.

LANDO:
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.

HAN:
Get out of here, Lando!

HAN:
I'm sorry too.

LANDO:
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.

HAN:
Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.

LANDO:
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?

HAN:
How's your mining operation going?

LANDO:
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.

HAN:
Hyperdrive.

LANDO:
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?

LANDO:
What have you done to my ship?

HAN:
Repairs ...

LANDO:
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?

LANDO:
I'll bet.

HAN:
I always said you were a gentleman.

LANDO:
Are you kidding?

HAN:
No hard feelings?

LANDO:
Why you slimy, doublecrossing nogood swindler ... am I glad to see you.

VADER:
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.

LANDO:
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in

VADER:
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.

LANDO:
I'll take what's mine now.

VADER:
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.

LANDO:
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.

VADER:
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.

LANDO:
No.

VADER:
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.

LANDO:
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.

VADER:
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.

LANDO:
What about Leia and the Wookiee?

LEIA:
That sounds familiar.

LANDO:
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.

LEIA:
Are the coordinates set?

LANDO:
The deflector shields are gone.

LEIA:
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.

LANDO:
Someone's falling.

LANDO:
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.

LEIA:
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!

LEIA:
Luke needs help.  We must go back.

LANDO:
What?

LEIA:
Luke!

LANDO:
I knew that setup was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.

LANDO:
I didn't say anything?

LEIA:
What'd you say?

LANDO:
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.

LEIA:
We've got to find Luke.

LANDO:
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.

LEIA:
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.

LEIA:
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...

LANDO:
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.

LEIA:
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.

LANDO:
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.

LANDO:
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.

LEIA:
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.

LANDO:
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.

LEIA:
We have no use for your kind.

LANDO:
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.

LEIA:
And when do you betray us again?

LANDO:
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.

LEIA:
What's going on?

LEIA:
... we're the bait.

LANDO:
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...

LANDO:
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.

LEIA:
What about Han?

LANDO:
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.

LEIA:
It's a lovely outpost.

LANDO:
Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.

LEIA:
You're part of the mining guild then?

LANDO:
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.

LANDO:
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?

LEIA:
Thanks.

LANDO:
I must say, your beauty is unpar alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.

LEIA:
Not really.

LANDO:
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?

LEIA:
You may call me Leia.

LANDO:
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?

RIEEKAN:
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.

LEIA:
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.

LEIA:
What is it?

RIEEKAN:
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.

RIEEKAN:
Not yet.  They're working on it now.

LEIA:
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?

RIEEKAN:
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...

LEIA:
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?

RIEEKAN:
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.

LEIA:
I understand.

RIEEKAN:
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.

LEIA:
Let's go.

THREEPIO:
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...

LEIA:
I thought you knew this person.

THREEPIO:
Rather touchy, aren't they.

LEIA:
Well, what now?

THREEPIO:
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.

THREEPIO:
Oh my, no!

LEIA:
What??

THREEPIO:
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.

LEIA:
A tremor!

LEIA:
Closer?!

THREEPIO:
Closer?!

THREEPIO:
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...

LEIA:
You don't have to do this to impress me.

LEIA:
I'll be back later.

THREEPIO:
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.

LEIA:
You rest now.

LUKE:
I've never seen it fail.

LEIA:
This hyperdrive had better work.

LUKE:
He'll survive.

LEIA:
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?

LEIA:
Luke, no!  It's a trap.

LUKE:
Leia!

LUKE:
Snow creatures ... they're here?!

LEIA:
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.

LUKE:
Jabba the Hutt?

LEIA:
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.

LUKE:
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.

LUKE:
Han's leaving?

LEIA:
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...

LUKE:
What are you talking about?

LEIA:
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?

LUKE:
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...

LEIA:
Where are you going?

LEIA:
What did you say?!

LUKE:
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?

LEIA:
Me too.  I was afraid.

LUKE:
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.

LEIA:
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?

YODA:
If it must be.  Yes.

LUKE:
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

LUKE:
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.

YODA:
Yes, yes.  To Obiwan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?

YODA:
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.

LUKE:
They're my friends.

YODA:
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!

LUKE:
Will they die?

YODA:
It is the future you see.

LUKE:
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.

YODA:
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.

LUKE:
I see a city in the clouds.

YODA:
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.

LUKE:
My mind fills with so many images.

YODA:
Free your mind and return he will.

LUKE:
Ben?  Ben?

YODA:
Only what you take with you.

LUKE:
What's in there?

YODA:
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.

LUKE:
I feel cold.

LUKE:
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.

YODA:
Four this time!  The Force you feel.

YODA:
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...

LUKE:
But tell me why ...

YODA:
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.

LUKE:
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?

YODA:
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.

LUKE:
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?

YODA:
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obiwan's apprentice.

LUKE:
Price?  What do you mean?

YODA:
Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.

LUKE:
But I feel The Force flowing!

YODA:
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.

YODA:
That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.

LUKE:
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.

YODA:
That they are.

LUKE:
I thought those seekers were set for stun!

YODA:
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.

YODA:
That is why you fail.

LUKE:
I don't believe it.

YODA:
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?

LUKE:
I can't. It's too big.

YODA:
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.

LUKE:
Okay.  I'll give it a try.

YODA:
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.

LUKE:
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.

YODA:
Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.

LUKE:
I thought I was in good shape.

YODA:
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.

YODA:
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.

LUKE:
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.

YODA:
You are reckless!

LUKE:
I have followed my feelings.

YODA:
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.

LUKE:
Why not me?

YODA:
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.

LUKE:
Never.

VADER:
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!

LUKE:
No! .... Never ....

VADER:
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.

LUKE:
Time will tell.

VADER:
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.

VADER:
That won't be necessary.

LUKE:
I'll die first.

VADER:
There is much Obiwan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.

LUKE:
No!

VADER:
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obiwan knew this to be true.

VADER:
And I too.

LUKE:
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

VADER:
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.

VADER:
I want that ship.

PIETT:
It won't get through the blockade.

VADER:
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?

PIETT:
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.

VADER:
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.

PIETT:
Yes, My Lord.

PIETT:
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...

VADER:
The Hoth System?

MICKEY:
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.

ANGIE:
But he was always a bad kid, that one.

MICKEY:
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy tendollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

ANGIE:
What? What happened?

MICKEY:
Look at Jeannie's kid.

ANGIE:
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.

BILLY:
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.

TOMMY:
No more shines, Billy.

BILLY:
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.

BILLY:
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.

TOMMY:
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?

BILLY:
Listen to him.  Watch the suit, he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.

TOMMY:
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.

BILLY:
Son of a bitch. Get over here.

TOMMY:
Billy, how are you?

BILLY:
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.

HENRY:
Thirtytwo hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirtytwo hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.

VARIO:
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.

VARIO:
You treated me like shit.

HENRY:
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.

HENRY:
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.

VARIO:
You thought I was some fucking jerk?

HENRY:
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...

VARIO:
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.

HENRY:
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.

VARIO:
You think I didn't know what you were doing?

HENRY:
I've been all fucked up since I got out.

VARIO:
I warned you a million times.

HENRY:
I understand.

VARIO:
Anybody!  You understand?

HENRY:
Nods again.

VARIO:
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.

HENRY:
Nods.

VARIO:
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?

HENRY:
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.

VARIO:
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?

HENRY:
Why would I get into that?

VARIO:
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.

HENRY:
Me? Why would I get into that shit?

VARIO:
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.

HENRY:
Wha?  Me?

VARIO:
I don't want any more of that Shit.

HENRY:
Oh I Him.

VARIO:
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.

HENRY:
The guy from near where Christie used to live?

VARIO:
No. No. The guy from downtown.

HENRY:
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?

VARIO:
What did you hear about that thing?

VARIO:
What?

HENRY:
Tell him. It's okay.

HENRY:
Yeah. What about the kids' school?

KAREN:
What about the schools?

KAREN:
I got scared.

HENRY:
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.

KAREN:
I got seared.

HENRY:
What happened? You okay?

KAREN:
Oh no! No!  Noooo!

HENRY:
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?

KAREN:
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.

HENRY:
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.

KAREN:
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.

HENRY:
You what?

KAREN:
I flushed it down the toilet.

HENRY:
You know. The stuff I left.

KAREN:
What are you talking about?

HENRY:
Where's the stuff?

HENRY:
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.

HENRY:
Just get me out.

KAREN:
Who's gonna do that?

HENRY:
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.

KAREN:
Then you're safer in here.

HENRY:
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.

KAREN:
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.

HENRY:
Paul will calm down. You'll see.

KAREN:
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.

HENRY:
What did he say, exactly?

KAREN:
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.

HENRY:
Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?

KAREN:
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.

HENRY:
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.

HENRY:
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.

KAREN:
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.

HENRY:
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.

KAREN:
With what?

HENRY:
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.

HENRY:
Never.

KAREN:
I don't want to hear about her anymore.

HENRY:
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.

KAREN:
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.

HENRY:
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.

KAREN:
I can't do it anymore.

HENRY:
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

KAREN:
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.

HENRY:
We've got to help each other.

KAREN:
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.

HENRY:
It'll be okay.

KAREN:
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?

KAREN:
Let her carry this shit inside.

HENRY:
Stop! Stop!

HENRY:
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.

KAREN:
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.

HENRY:
Jezuz Christ!

KAREN:
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.

HENRY:
What are you talking about?

KAREN:
You son of a bitch. She's been here.

HENRY:
Shit.

KAREN:
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.

HENRY:
I'm just having my last few drinks.

KAREN:
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?

HENRY:
Son of a bitch.

KAREN:
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?

HENRY:
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.

HENRY:
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.

KAREN:
Henry.  Wake up.

HENRY:
That again.

KAREN:
I don't care. Something's going on.

HENRY:
How much?

KAREN:
I'm gonna need some money.

HENRY:
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.

KAREN:
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband

HENRY:
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.

KAREN:
The bag with the envelopes.

HENRY:
What bag?

KAREN:
My bag. My bag.

HENRY:
Get inside!

KAREN:
What are you gonna do?

HENRY:
Go inside. I'll be right there.

KAREN:
They don't feel like you're in construction.

HENRY:
I'm in construction.

KAREN:
What do you do?

HENRY:
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.

KAREN:
What're you doing? What about the car?

HENRY:
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?

KAREN:
Talk? To you? After what you did!

HENRY:
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.

HENRY:
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.

KAREN:
Liar!

HENRY:
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.

HENRY:
I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.

KAREN:
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.

HENRY:
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a backup guy.

JIMMY:
I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.

HENRY:
Yeah.

JIMMY:
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.

HENRY:
Yeah.

JIMMY:
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.

HENRY:
How?

JIMMY:
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.

HENRY:
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.

HENRY:
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.

HENRY:
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.

JIMMY:
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.

HENRY:
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.

JIMMY:
I better call again.

HENRY:
Nah.

JIMMY:
You want the melon?

HENRY:
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.

JIMMY:
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.

HENRY:
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?

JIMMY:
Watch this.

JIMMY:
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.

HENRY:
What'll I tell Fran?

JIMMY:
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.

HENRY:
Paulie's gonna make him?

JIMMY:
So what?  Where are they gonna go?

HENRY:
There are cops all over the place.

JIMMY:
Don't worry about it.

HENRY:
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?

JIMMY:
Oh yeah? Anything you say.

JIMMY:
Have a drink first.

HENRY:
I gotta talk to you.

JIMMY:
Give'm a drink.

JIMMY:
We did it.  We did it.

HENRY:
Jimmy.

JIMMY:
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.

JIMMY:
We only have to shove'em over the moat.

HENRY:
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.

JIMMY:
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.

JIMMY:
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.

HENRY:
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.

JIMMY:
It's still better than letting somebody find him.

HENRY:
It's been six months.

JIMMY:
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.

HENRY:
What?

JIMMY:
Well, we gotta dig him up again.

HENRY:
Paulie was just talking about him.

JIMMY:
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?

HENRY:
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.

JIMMY:
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?

HENRY:
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.

JIMMY:
Keep 'em coming.

JIMMY:
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.

HENRY:
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.

HENRY:
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.

MARTY:
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.

HENRY:
He heard.

MARTY:
I want to talk to Jimmy.

HENRY:
Will you stop.

MARTY:
And Jimmy's in it, right?

HENRY:
Done.

MARTY:
It's a fait accompli?

HENRY:
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.

MARTY:
I didn't agree to three points over the vig. What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.

HENRY:
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.

TODDY:
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy.

TODDY:
You're some fucking jerk.

HENRY:
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.

HENRY:
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.

TODDY:
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?

HENRY:
I can't make any more deliveries.

TODDY:
What happened to you?

HENRY:
What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.

JUDY:
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.

HENRY:
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?

JUDY:
I gotta go home and get my hat.

HENRY:
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.

JUDY:
I gotta go home.

HENRY:
Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?

JUDY:
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!

HENRY:
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.

JUDY:
Yeah, yeah.

HENRY:
You know what to do?

HENRY:
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.

JUDY:
Yeah.

HENRY:
You ready?

HENRY:
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?

JUDY:
Where'd you find such creeps?

TOMMY:
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.

HENRY:
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.

TOMMY:
No, no. It's okay.

HENRY:
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!

HENRY:
Tommy  ...

TOMMY:
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?

HENRY:
Will you get the fuck out of here.

TOMMY:
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.

TOMMY:
There's a shovel at my mother's.

HENRY:
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.

TOMMY:
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.

HENRY:
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.

TOMMY:
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.

HENRY:
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.

TOMMY:
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.

HENRY:
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.

ROBIN:
Okay?

HENRY:
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?

ROBIN:
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...

HENRY:
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.

ROBIN:
Are you okay? What happened?

ROBIN:
So do I.

HENRY:
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.

ROBIN:
I hate to do dishes.

HENRY:
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.

ROBIN:
Stay there.

KAREN:
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.

JIMMY:
The third store down.

JIMMY:
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.

KAREN:
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.

JIMMY:
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.

KAREN:
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.

JIMMY:
Did he say what they're asking him about?

KAREN:
He's okay. They sobered him up.

JIMMY:
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?

KAREN:
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.

KAREN:
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?

KAREN'S MOTHER:
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?

KAREN:
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?

KAREN'S MOTHER:
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.

KAREN:
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.

KAREN:
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
What kind of person doesn't call?

KAREN:
He's with his friends.

KAREN'S MOTHER:
He didn't call?

KAREN:
That's important.

MCDONALD:
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.

KAREN:
I don't want them left back.

MCDONALD:
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.

MCDONALD:
We'll pick it up.

KAREN:
I got dry cleaning.

MCDONALD:
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.

SONNY:
Please?

VARIO:
You want a partner?

VARIO:
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?

SONNY:
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.

VARIO:
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.

SONNY:
But, Paulie, please.

VARIO:
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.

SONNY:
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.

VARIO:
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.

SONNY:
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.

VARIO:
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?

TOM:
Well not exactly, no I got 'em sitting in the car, actually I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.

BACON:
Well, talk.

TOM:
I wanted to talk to you about that.

BACON:
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?

TOM:
A what?

BACON:
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.

TOM:
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?

TOM:
Seven hundred for the pair.

BACON:
How much did you part with?

TOM:
Well, it's still a good idea.

BACON:
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?

TOM:
Probably no longer than four weeks.

BACON:
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?

BACON:
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?

TOM:
I'll kill him!

BACON:
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. '  Cut from completed film.

TOM:
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.

BACON:
Jesus, Tom, do they work?

SOAP:
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.

BACON:
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.

SOAP:
It's hit us all hard!

BACON:
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days it's hit him hard.

SOAP:
I would rather put my money on a threelegged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?

BACON:
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.

BACON:
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.

SOAP:
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that illfated individuals owe for an array of reasons.

EDDY:
And Tom took care of them.

BACON:
Apart from those shotguns.

EDDY:
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.

EDDY:
Well what?

BACON:
Well?

BACON:
Think about what you're going to say, Ed we are on thin ice.

EDDY:
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.

EDDY:
That inspires confidence, that does.

BACON:
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!

EDDY:
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.

BACON:
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?

BACON:
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed we've got a shit load of cash and we've got a . . . traffic warden.

EDDY:
Bacon, see what we got.

EDDY:
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.

BACON:
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.

BACON:
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.

EDDY:
Yes?

EDDY:
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?

BACON:
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.

EDDY:
I'll think of something, don't worry.

BACON:
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteeninch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.

BACON:
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to a bit antisocial, you know.

EDDY:
Because it's cheap like a budgie.

EDDY:
I still will, if you don't mind.

BACON:
Twentyfive from me, Tom, Soap and yourself a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.

BACON:
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.

EDDY:
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man Barry the Baptist.

EDDY:
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.

BACON:
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.

SAMOAN JO:
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.

BACON:
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?

SAMOAN JO:
It's a Samoan pub.

BACON:
I thought this was a pub.

SAMOAN JO:
You want a pint, go to the pub.

BACON:
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest you could fall in love with an orangutan in that.

SAMOAN JO:
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.

BACON:
What's that?

BARRY:
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Backyouup witha Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?

DEAN:
Yeah, Bazza, what?

BARRY:
Inside, outfuckin'side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .

DEAN:
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.

BARRY:
You fucking well have to get 'em!

BARRY:
I am not fucking interested.

DEAN:
They were . . .

BARRY:
Well you just better unsell 'em, sharpish.

DEAN:
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammerlock muskets the butler was carrying they were ours, and we sold 'em!

BARRY:
There were two old guns there where are they?

DEAN:
I don't know what you mean.

BARRY:
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?

DEAN:
There are no others.

BARRY:
Where're the others?

DEAN:
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.

DEAN:
You should see what they did to poor Gary.

BARRY:
You get the guns?

DEAN:
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!

BARRY:
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.

DEAN:
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?

BARRY:
Like antiques.

DEAN:
Like what?

HATCHET:
Don't play innocent with me Bazza spanking!

BARRY:
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?

HATCHET:
Good, you can get this under control now.

BARRY:
No mortgage, no debts lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.

HATCHET:
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?

HATCHET:
Where did he get a hundred grand?

BARRY:
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.

HATCHET:
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.

BARRY:
Fucking Northern monkeys.

GARY:
I hate these Southern shites.

BARRY:
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.

GARY:
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?

BARRY:
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.

GARY:
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?

BARRY:
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.

GARY:
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.

BARRY:
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep it's yours.

GARY:
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?

JD:
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.

BIG CHRIS:
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.

JD:
Yes?

BIG CHRIS:
I think I can help you, as it happens.

JD:
Can I help?

BIG CHRIS:
Nope.

JD:
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?

BIG CHRIS:
JD.

HATCHET:
Good job, Chris.

BIG CHRIS:
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.

HATCHET:
They were going to pay, then?

BIG CHRIS:
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.

HATCHET:
Have you counted the money?

HATCHET:
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.

BIG CHRIS:
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things wondered if you wanted them?

BIG CHRIS:
No Harry, you can't.

HATCHET:
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?

BIG CHRIS:
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL:
I won't be seeing you again Chris I have paid him every last penny.

BIG CHRIS:
Hello, John. Nice holiday?

JOHN O'DRISCOLL:
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?

BIG CHRIS:
Son, have a look in his locker.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL:
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.

BIG CHRIS:
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL:
Jesus Christ!

BIG CHRIS:
Mind your language in front of my boy.

DOG:
You had better be careful.

BIG CHRIS:
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.

DOG:
What are you doing?

BIG CHRIS:
All right, furry muff.

DOG:
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chopfuckin'chop.

BIG CHRIS:
It's in an office I have just left it in the office. 137

DOG:
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?

BIG CHRIS:
You all right back there, mate?

DOG:
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?

BIG CHRIS:
Son?

BIG CHRIS:
Well, put your seatbelt on then.

LITTLE CHRIS:
All right, Dad.

BIG CHRIS:
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money loaning business, all right, son?

BIG CHRIS:
Try that one.

LITTLE CHRIS:
It's not him, Dad.

BIG CHRIS:
Let's have a look, shall we?

LITTLE CHRIS:
Just carrying a bag.

BIG CHRIS:
Is he on his own?

LITTLE CHRIS:
About twenty minutes.

BIG CHRIS:
How long has he been in there, son?

NICK:
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand I am not going to see them or the guns again.

DEAN:
I got the money to pay for 'em.

NICK:
Not likely I am afraid I don't think I'll be seeing them again.

DEAN:
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.

NICK:
What can I do for you?

DEAN:
Sure is.

NICK:
Is that you, Dean?

DEAN:
That's no way to answer the phone.

NICK:
Yeah?

GARY:
Furry muff, let's go.

DEAN:
Listen, I don't care who lives in there all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.

GARY:
This is dangerous shit, Dean we don't even know who lives in there.

DEAN:
We gotta get those guns.

DEAN:
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold we gotta find 'em.

GARY:
Jesus, I have heard about him.

DEAN:
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.

GARY:
Who was that?

GARY:
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.

DEAN:
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?

GARY:
All right, Kenny.

DEAN:
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?

JOHN:
But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.

DOG:
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.

JOHN:
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?

DOG:
The stupid bastards! Count it!

JOHN:
Dog, I have found the cash!

DOG:
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fuckingstrosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?

JOHN:
Er well, yes we do.

DOG:
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?

DOG:
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.

JOHN:
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.

DOG:
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.

DOG:
How about you? All right?

PLANK:
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?

DOG:
OK, open the gate.

PLANK:
Yeah, one of them's out.

DOG:
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.

PLANK:
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.

DOG:
Just give me the keys.

PLANK:
It must be this one.

PLANK:
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.

DOG:
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?

PLANK:
Just hold on, I got the keys.

m422:
DOG

DOG:
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?

PLANK:
No.

DOG:
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?

DOG:
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.

PLANK:
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.

PLANK:
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle they're gutless faggots.

DOG:
Is there no way they can get back to you?

PLANK:
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.

DOG:
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?

PLANK:
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.

PLANK:
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.

DOG:
What they like then?

PLANK:
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.

DOG:
So do you know these geezers well?

WINSTON:
Out the back.

DOG:
And the weed?

WINSTON:
Out the back.

DOG:
Where?

DOG:
Plank?

WINSTON:
I mean it, there is only three of us here.

DOG:
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?

WINSTON:
There is only three of us here.

DOG:
And all your friends, there's a good lad.

WINSTON:
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.

DOG:
Right, his leg's going now.

DOG:
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.

WINSTON:
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.

DOG:
What the fuck is going on?

WINSTON:
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.

DOORMAN:
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.

EDDY:
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .

DOORMAN:
All right, just you the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.

EDDY:
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?

DOORMAN:
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.

EDDY:
Invitations?

DOORMAN:
Invitations.

EDDY:
I mean it's fucking empty.

SOAP:
What do you mean?

EDDY:
There's nothing in it!

EDDY:
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.

SOAP:
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.

EDDY:
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.

SOAP:
Well, what's going on?

EDDY:
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.

SOAP:
You what? What are you on about?

EDDY:
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.

SOAP:
I hope this is the right move.

EDDY:
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.

SOAP:
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?

EDDY:
That's it all done, we are off.

EDDY:
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.

SOAP:
And look what happened to that.

EDDY:
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.

SOAP:
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.

EDDY:
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?

SOAP:
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.

EDDY:
No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still

SOAP:
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.

EDDY:
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.

EDDY:
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...

SOAP:
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .

EDDY:
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!

SOAP:
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?

EDDY:
Hit the fuckers.

SOAP:
Well, what do you want us to do about it?

SOAP:
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?

EDDY:
Are you sure you can afford twentyfive?

TOM:
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?

EDDY:
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?

TOM:
I'll only be a minute.

EDDY:
Tom?

TOM:
I'11 meet you in the car.

EDDY:
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.

EDDY:
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.

TOM:
. . . What?

EDDY:
Tom, this is our case.

TOM:
What do you mean, me?

EDDY:
You and me, Tom.

EDDY:
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.

TOM:
Well, what did he say?

EDDY:
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?

TOM:
Right as rain.

EDDY:
Everything all right out there, Tom?

EDDY:
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.

TOM:
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.

TOM:
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!

EDDY:
Why, what's up?

TOM:
What the hell are you doing here?

EDDY:
He means they're thieving dogs.

TOM:
What do you mean?

EDDY:
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.

TOM:
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.

EDDY:
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.

TOM:
Who's this fat man, then?

HATCHET:
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!

EDDY:
I wanted to talk to you about that.

HATCHET:
It's pay day, ain't it?

EDDY:
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.

HATCHET:
That you, boy?

HATCHET:
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

EDDY:
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.

HATCHET:
For half a million?

EDDY:
I'll see ya.

HATCHET:
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.

EDDY:
That's if I want to see you.

HATCHET:
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.

EDDY:
I need two hundred and fifty grand.

HATCHET:
I am not interested in what you would rather I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.

EDDY:
I think I would rather just turn them over.

HATCHET:
I will loan you the money.

EDDY:
You will what?

HATCHET:
I will.

HATCHET:
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY

EDDY:
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.

HATCHET:
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.

EDDY:
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.

HATCHET:
You must be Eddy. JD's son.

EDDY:
A hundred grand.

HATCHET:
You got it all?

JD:
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!

HATCHET:
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.

JD:
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his earhole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.

HATCHET:
Do you want me to draw a picture?

JD:
And?

HATCHET:
I want your bar.

JD:
Yes?

HATCHET:
I like your bar.

JD:
Go on.

PLANK:
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.

J:
What are you doing, Plank?

PLANK:
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.

J:
Sorry, got to do business like this now can't be too careful these days.

PLANK:
Lives and learns doesn't one.

J:
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.

PLANK:
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.

J:
Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.

PLANK:
I think you'll find it is in your interest.

J:
I can't help you, Plank.

PLANK:
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?

J:
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.

PLANK:
Well, perhaps you can help?

J:
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.

PLANK:
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?

J:
Hello, can I help you?

NICK:
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.

TOM:
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?

NICK:
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.

TOM:
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.

NICK:
Sawnoffs are out, Tom people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.

NICK:
Seven hundred each.

TOM:
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?

NICK:
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.

TOM:
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?

TOM:
I think you're Nick the Greek.

NICK:
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?

TOM:
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawnoff shotguns.

NICK:
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.

TOM:
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.

NICK:
Doesn't sound very good to me.

TOM:
Not normal weed. This is some fuckedup skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.

TOM:
You know it doesn't include the amp.

NICK:
And that does include the amp?

TOM:
You know how much it is, Nick.

NICK:
How much did you say it was, Tom?

NICK:
Of course you are. All right, Ed.

TOM:
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.

PAUL:
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.

TRAFFIC WARDEN:
So?

PAUL:
My van is half full.

TRAFFIC WARDEN:
At what, exactly?

PAUL:
Look. Go on, look.

TRAFFIC WARDEN:
You've already been fifteen.

PAUL:
I'll only be a minute.

TRAFFIC WARDEN:
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.

SOAP:
OK, don't panic let's think about this.

TOM:
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.

SOAP:
The money, the gear!

TOM:
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?

SOAP:
How the fuck should I know?

TOM:
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?

SOAP:
Er, well, twelve.

TOM:
How many feet?

SOAP:
Twelve.

TOM:
How many wings have they got between them?

SOAP:
Six.

TOM:
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?

SOAP:
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.

TOM:
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.

SOAP:
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.

TOM:
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?

SOAP:
What about all the gear?

TOM:
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.

SOAP:
What's left over?'

SOAP:
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.

TOM:
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?

TOM:
Nick the Greek.

SOAP:
Where did you get those from, a museum?

SOAP:
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!

TOM:
It's the mother of fuckups, stupid!

SOAP:
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuckups?

TOM:
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays it's in all our interests.

SOAP:
Tom, you're all heart.

TOM:
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.

SOAP:
You're not funny Tom you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.

TOM:
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.

SOAP:
That's going on optimism.

TOM:
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twentyfive grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.

SOAP:
Get your fingers out of my soup!

TOM:
If you will order stuff that comes from KatManFuckingDu don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route.  Never mind that, what about the money?

SOAP:
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.

TOM:
What have you come as?

WINSTON:
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average horterfuckingculturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.

WILLY:
What do you mean?

WINSTON:
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?

WILLY:
We need fertilizer, Winston.

WINSTON:
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.

WILLY:
Er, fertilizer.

WINSTON:
What are you carrying, Willy?

WINSTON:
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.

WILLY:
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?

ADAM:
Git along little dowgie and call me back.

CYNTHIA:
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.

ADAM:
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.

CYNTHIA:
I'm just offering a place to stay.

ADAM:
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.

CYNTHIA:
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.

ADAM:
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?

CYNTHIA:
Will you meet with him?

ADAM:
You gotta be kidding?

CYNTHIA:
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.

ADAM:
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?

CYNTHIA:
It's been a very strange day.

ADAM:
Cynthia...what's going on?

CYNTHIA:
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.

ADAM:
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?

CYNTHIA:
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.

ADAM:
The Cowboy??

CYNTHIA:
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?

ADAM:
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.

CYNTHIA:
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?

ADAM:
But I'm not broke.

CYNTHIA:
You're broke!

ADAM:
And?

CYNTHIA:
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.

ADAM:
What do you mean you know?

CYNTHIA:
I know.  Where are you Adam?

ADAM:
Someone's shut off my money!

ADAM:
I'm going home. I'll call you later.

CYNTHIA:
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.

ADAM:
I'm going home Cynthia.

CYNTHIA:
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!

ADAM:
I'm going home.

CYNTHIA:
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.

ADAM:
No.

CYNTHIA:
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!

ADAM:
Who fired everyone?

CYNTHIA:
They fired everyone.

ADAM:
What did you say?

CYNTHIA:
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.

ADAM:
What's going on, Cynthia?

CYNTHIA:
Adam, where are you?

ADAM:
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a setup to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!

RAY:
I'll speak to someone.

ADAM:
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!

ADAM:
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.

RAY:
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.

ADAM:
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.

RAY:
There is no problem.

ADAM:
So what's the problem?

ADAM:
Okay.

COWBOY:
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.

ADAM:
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?

COWBOY:
You're an understandin' fella.

ADAM:
I understand.

COWBOY:
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?

ADAM:
It will work out.

COWBOY:
Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...

ADAM:
Okay.

COWBOY:
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.

ADAM:
One.

COWBOY:
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?

ADAM:
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?

COWBOY:
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?

ADAM:
Okay, I'm thinking.

COWBOY:
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?

ADAM:
How's that?

COWBOY:
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.

ADAM:
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.

COWBOY:
What did I say?

ADAM:
I agree with what you said...truly.

COWBOY:
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?

ADAM:
Sure.

COWBOY:
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?

ADAM:
Whatever.

COWBOY:
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?

ADAM:
No problem. What's on your mind?

COWBOY:
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.

ADAM:
Yeah.

COWBOY:
Beautiful night.

ADAM:
Howdy to you.

COWBOY:
Howdy!

HOTEL MANAGER:
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.

ADAM:
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.

HOTEL MANAGER:
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.

ADAM:
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?

HOTEL MANAGER:
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.

ADAM:
So, what did they say?

HOTEL MANAGER:
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.

ADAM:
How...  how'd they know I was here?

HOTEL MANAGER:
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.

ADAM:
... What??

HOTEL MANAGER:
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.

ADAM:
Yes...what is it?

COCO:
Good luck, honey!

BETTY:
Right. See ya.

COCO:
Get going. You don't want to be late.

BETTY:
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.

COCO:
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.

BETTY:
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing

COCO:
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.

BETTY:
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.

COCO:
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?

BETTY:
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.

COCO:
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble  get rid of it.

BETTY:
You're really something Coco...thank you.

BETTY:
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.

COCO:
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.

BETTY:
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.

COCO:
Sweetie, look at me straight.

BETTY:
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...

COCO:
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.

BETTY:
I was afraid of that.

COCO:
Your Aunt called me.

COCO:
You got it! See you later honey.

BETTY:
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

COCO:
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.

BETTY:
Wow!

COCO:
I told ya.

BETTY:
It's unbelievable!

BETTY:
I can hardly wait, Coco.

COCO:
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.

BETTY:
No, I don't.

COCO:
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.

BETTY:
I guess I've come to quite a place.

COCO:
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.

BETTY:
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.

COCO:
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.

BETTY:
I...

COCO:
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called tits and ass.

BETTY:
Well, I ...

COCO:
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.

BETTY:
Yes, he is. He raises corn.

COCO:
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.

BETTY:
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?

DARKHAIRED WOMAN:
My name is Rita.

BETTY:
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.

DARKHAIRED WOMAN:
I think so. I was just taking a shower.

BETTY:
Are you okay?

DARKHAIRED WOMAN:
A car ... a car accident.

BETTY:
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?

DARKHAIRED WOMAN:
There was an accident. I came here.

BETTY:
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.

DARKHAIRED WOMAN:
That's okay.

WALLY:
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?

BETTY:
No, no, I'm fine.

WALLY:
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?

BETTY:
Hi.

WALLY:
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.

BETTY:
Very pleased to meet you.

WALLY:
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.

BETTY:
Yes.

WALLY:
Betty Elms?

JIMMY:
Before what?

BETTY:
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...

JIMMY:
But you won't.

BETTY:
I can call them... I can call my dad.

JIMMY:
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

BETTY:
You're still here?

JIMMY:
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.

BETTY:
Betty.

JIMMY:
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?

BETTY:
What?

JIMMY:
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

SERGEANT BAXTER:
May I have your name please?

BETTY:
Was anyone hurt?

SERGEANT BAXTER:
No. I can't.

BETTY:
Can you tell me what happened?

SERGEANT BAXTER:
Yes, there was.

BETTY:
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.

MIDDLEAGED WOMAN:
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.

BETTY:
Well ... we'll leave her a note.

MIDDLEAGED WOMAN:
I switched apartments with her. She's in 17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.

BETTY:
But it said 12.

MIDDLEAGED WOMAN:
Number 17.

BETTY:
Diane?

MIDDLEAGED WOMAN:
Yes?

BETTY:
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.

RITA:
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.

BETTY:
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.

RITA:
But I want to.

BETTY:
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.

BETTY:
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.

RITA:
What ... I..HAVE... to do.

BETTY:
Rita... I know what you're doing.

RITA:
No.

BETTY:
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.

RITA:
I don't think...

BETTY:
Keep going. Go around to the back.

RITA:
No... but...

BETTY:
Do you know them?!

RITA:
Those men in front, in the car.

BETTY:
What is it? What do you see?!

RITA:
Don't stop!

BETTY:
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.

RITA:
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.

BETTY:
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!

RITA:
Okay.

BETTY:
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.

RITA:
Good luck!

BETTY:
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.

BETTY:
Everything is Aokay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!

RITA:
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?

BETTY:
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.

RITA:
I'm all right.

BETTY:
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?

RITA:
Then they'd put you in jail.

BETTY:
Before I kill you.

RITA:
Before what?

BETTY:
Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...

RITA:
What about you? What will your dad think about you?

BETTY:
Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything...

RITA:
You know what I want...it's not that difficult.

BETTY:
You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work.

RITA:
But you won't...

BETTY:
I can call them... I can call my dad...

RITA:
So... surprise...

BETTY:
My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left...

RITA:
Really?

RITA:
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

BETTY:
You're still here?

BETTY:
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.

RITA:
I'm not sure about this.

BETTY:
What's wrong with that?

RITA:
Maybe...maybe ... maybe.

BETTY:
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.

RITA:
It's not my voice ... but I know her.

BETTY:
Call the number.

RITA:
Maybe it's not me.

BETTY:
Strange to be calling yourself.

BETTY:
We'll take our check.

RITA:
No. Just the coffee.

BETTY:
Not that I can see.

RITA:
There's nothing?

BETTY:
Come on... let's find you something to wear.

RITA:
Okay.

BETTY:
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.

RITA:
Okay... but just...just to see.

BETTY:
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.

RITA:
No.... I don't...

BETTY:
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.

RITA:
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.

BETTY:
Mulholland Drive?

RITA:
Mulholland Drive.

BETTY:
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?

RITA:
Unh, unh.

BETTY:
The money. You don't know where it came from?

RITA:
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.

BETTY:
You don't remember anything else?

RITA:
I don't know.

BETTY:
How do you remember how to talk?

RITA:
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.

BETTY:
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?

RITA:
What do you mean?

BETTY:
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?

RITA:
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!

BETTY:
What do you mean? You're Rita.

RITA:
I don't know who I am.

BETTY:
What's wrong?

RITA:
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...

BETTY:
What is it Rita?

BETTY:
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.

RITA:
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.

BETTY:
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.

RITA:
No...I need to sleep.

BETTY:
But, this could be serious.

RITA:
No.

BETTY:
Oh...

RITA:
I think I've been hurt.

BETTY:
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.

RITA:
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.

BETTY:
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.

RITA:
No ..........I.

BETTY:
Thank you... thank you very much.

PARAMOUNT GUARD:
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.

BETTY:
Betty Elms.

PARAMOUNT GUARD:
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?

BETTY:
Yes, Sir.

PARAMOUNT GUARD:
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?

BETTY:
No, we don't.

PARAMOUNT GUARD:
And do we know which of the fiftyseven buildings Wally Brown is in?

BETTY:
Wally Brown.

PARAMOUNT GUARD:
And who are we auditioning for today?

BETTY:
To my audition.

JOE:
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.

BILLY:
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.

JOE:
What's  the matter now?

BILLY:
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.

JOE:
Yeah, what for?

BILLY:
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.

JOE:
You're so easy.

BILLY:
My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.

JOE:
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.

BILLY:
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.

HERB:
Right then.

DAN:
To get rid of this godawful feeling.

HERB:
So, you came to see if he's out there?

DAN:
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is  there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.

HERB:
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.

DAN:
You see what I mean...

HERB:
Oh boy.

DAN:
I had a dream about this place.

HERB:
Go ahead.

DAN:
It's kind of embarrassing but,

HERB:
Okay. Why this Denny's?

DAN:
This Denny's.

HERB:
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?

DAN:
I just wanted to come here.

HERB:
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Damn, that's a long drive.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Palmdale.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Where at?

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Interesting.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Find out who they are?

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knifelike torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain  all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Oh yeah.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
The one of 'em still alive?

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Nice wallets.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
That's what I'm thinkin'.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Could be unrelated.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Yeah, they showed me

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.

DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD:
Yeah.

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT:
You feel it?

JOE:
Yeah, that's a funny story.

ED:
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.

JOE:
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.

ED:
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.

JOE:
Hardly.

ED:
Making ends meet, huh.

JOE:
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.

ED:
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?

JOE:
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.

LANEY:
Sure.

JOE:
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?

LANEY:
No...

JOE:
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?

LANEY:
No.  I haven't seen any.

JOE:
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.

LANEY:
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.

JOE:
Not a coke or anything?

LANEY:
Not here...no thanks.

LANDO:
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!

ACKBAR:
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.

LANDO:
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.

ACKBAR:
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.

LANDO:
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

ACKBAR:
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.

LANDO:
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

ACKBAR:
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

LANDO:
All right. Stand by.

ACKBAR:
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.

ACKBAR:
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.

LANDO:
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.

BEN:
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!

LUKE:
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.

BEN:
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

LUKE:
Leia! Leia's my sister.

BEN:
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

LUKE:
But I have no sister.

BEN:
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

LUKE:
Yoda spoke of another.

BEN:
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.

LUKE:
I can't kill my own father.

BEN:
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side  the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door  for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!

LUKE:
But I had to help my friends.

BEN:
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.

LUKE:
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.

BEN:
You cannot escape your destiny.

LUKE:
I can't do it, Ben.

BEN:
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

LUKE:
There's still good in him.

BEN:
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.

LUKE:
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.

BEN:
Yoda will always be with you.

LUKE:
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.

HAN:
Who are you?

BOUSHH:
Jabba's palace.

HAN:
Where am I?

BOUSHH:
Your eyesight will return in time.

HAN:
I can't see.

BOUSHH:
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.

VADER:
His lightsaber.

EMPEROR:
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.

EMPEROR:
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.

VADER:
They are clear, my Master.

EMPEROR:
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

VADER:
I have felt him, my Master.

VADER:
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.

EMPEROR:
I told you to remain on the command ship.

VADER:
Yes, my Master.

EMPEROR:
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.

VADER:
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?

EMPEROR:
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.

VADER:
What is thy bidding, my Master?

EMPEROR:
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

VADER:
As you wish.

EMPEROR:
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.

VADER:
Yes, my Master.

EMPEROR:
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.

VADER:
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

LUKE:
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.

HAN:
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.

LUKE:
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

HAN:
Hey!

HAN:
Yeah, sure.

LUKE:
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

HAN:
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.

LUKE:
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.

HAN:
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.

LUKE:
We got separated.

HAN:
I thought she was with you.

LUKE:
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.

HAN:
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.

HAN:
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

LUKE:
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.

HAN:
I don't know.  Fly casual.

HAN:
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.

LUKE:
Vader's on that ship.

LUKE:
All set.

HAN:
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?

LUKE:
Yeah, she's comin' up.

HAN:
You got her warmed?

LUKE:
Hi, Han... Chewie.

HAN:
Luke.

LUKE:
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

HAN:
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?

HAN:
Oh... great!

LUKE:
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.

HAN:
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.

LUKE:
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.

HAN:
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.

HAN:
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?

LUKE:
The same as always.

HAN:
How are we doing?

LUKE:
Wouldn't miss it.

HAN:
Fine. Together again, huh?

LUKE:
Are you all right?

HAN:
Luke!

LUKE:
Han!

HAN:
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.

LEIA:
Yes.

HAN:
You love him, don't you?

LEIA:
He wasn't. I can feel it.

HAN:
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.

HAN:
Here's the terminal.

LEIA:
The code's changed. We need Artoo!

HAN:
Charges!  Come on, come on!

LEIA:
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.

HAN:
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.

LEIA:
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.

LEIA:
Hold me.

HAN:
I'm sorry.

HAN:
Ahhh...

LEIA:
I...

LEIA:
I don't know.

HAN:
What's going on?

HAN:
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

LEIA:
Shall we try and go around?

HAN:
It'll work. It'll work.

LEIA:
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

HAN:
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.

LEIA:
Hey, are you awake?

LEIA:
That's all any of us can see.

HAN:
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!

LEIA:
I gotta get you out of here.

HAN:
Leia!

LEIA:
Someone who loves you.

HAN:
You, too.

LANDO:
Good luck.

LANDO:
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. Sheshe won't get a scratch. All right?

HAN:
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

LANDO:
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.

HAN:
Well, look at you, a general, huh?

LANDO:
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.

HAN:
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.

LANDO:
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

HAN:
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.

LANDO:
No, wait! I thought you were blind!

HAN:
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.

HAN:
I'm trying!

LANDO:
Lower it!

HAN:
Lando, grab it!

HAN:
Lando!

LANDO:
Han! Chewie?

HAN:
Let's see.

THREEPIO:
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?

HAN:
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

THREEPIO:
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?

THREEPIO:
Oh, Artoo, hurry!

HAN:
Come on! Come on!

THREEPIO:
We're coming!

THREEPIO:
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.

HAN:
What did he say?

THREEPIO:
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.

HAN:
Proper?!

THREEPIO:
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.

HAN:
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?

THREEPIO:
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

HAN:
What are you telling them?

HAN:
All right, hang on.

THREEPIO:
Here we go again.

HAN:
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?

THREEPIO:
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.

THREEPIO:
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the allpowerful Sarlacc.

HAN:
Good, I hate long waits.

THREEPIO:
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.

VADER:
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

JERJERROD:
We shall double our efforts.

VADER:
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.

VADER:
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

JERJERROD:
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

VADER:
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

JERJERROD:
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.

VADER:
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.

JERJERROD:
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.

VADER:
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.

JERJERROD:
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.

WEDGE:
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

LANDO:
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.

WEDGE:
There it is!

WEDGE:
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.

LANDO:
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.

LANDO:
Here goes nothing.

WEDGE:
I'm going in.

LANDO:
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.

WEDGE:
Good shot, Red Two.

WEDGE:
Red Leader standing by.

LANDO:
All wings report in.

LEIA:
Oh, no.

THREEPIO:
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.

LEIA:
Quiet.

THREEPIO:
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!

THREEPIO:
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

LEIA:
What's he saying?

THREEPIO:
Your Royal Highness.

LEIA:
Oh!

THREEPIO:
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.

LEIA:
Ugh!

LUKE:
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.

LEIA:
But, why must you confront him?

LUKE:
No, you don't. You've always been strong.

LEIA:
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.

LUKE:
Then you know why I have to face him.

LEIA:
I know. Somehow...I've always known.

LUKE:
Yes. It's you Leia.

LUKE:
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.

LEIA:
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power II don't understand and could never have.

LUKE:
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

LEIA:
Your father?

LUKE:
He's my father.

LUKE:
Vader is here...now, on this moon.

LEIA:
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

LUKE:
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

LEIA:
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?

LUKE:
Tell me.

LEIA:
Just...images, really. Feelings.

LUKE:
What do you remember?

LEIA:
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.

LUKE:
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?

LUKE:
I see them. Wait, Leia!

LEIA:
Over there! Two more of them!

LUKE:
Neverrr!

VADER:
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. ObiWan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.

VADER:
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...

LUKE:
I will not fight you.

VADER:
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

VADER:
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.

LUKE:
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.

VADER:
There is no conflict.

LUKE:
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.

LUKE:
I will not fight you, father.

VADER:
ObiWan has taught you well.

VADER:
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.

LUKE:
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.

VADER:
If that is your destiny.

LUKE:
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.

VADER:
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.

VADER:
ObiWan once thought as you do.

LUKE:
Come with me.

VADER:
So, you have accepted the truth.

LUKE:
I know, father.

VADER:
The Emperor has been expecting you.

YODA:
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

LUKE:
Well, I'm sorry.

LUKE:
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

YODA:
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...

LUKE:
Yes.

YODA:
Told you, did he?

YODA:
Your father he is.

LUKE:
Yoda, I must know.

YODA:
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.

LUKE:
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.

YODA:
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.

LUKE:
Master Yoda, you can't die.

THREEPIO:
Disintegrated?

NINEDENINE:
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.

THREEPIO:
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...

NINEDENINE:
How many languages do you speak?

THREEPIO:
Oh. Well, yes.

NINEDENINE:
Yes or no will do.

THREEPIO:
I am SeeThreepio, humancy...

NINEDENINE:
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?

BEN:
May the Force be with you.

HAN:
We'll be back before you are, old man.

BEN:
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.

HAN:
I'm not going out there.

BEN:
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?

HAN:
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.

BEN:
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.

HAN:
Is that good or bad?

BEN:
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.

HAN:
What do you want with our scanproof lockers?

BEN:
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan shielded compartments.

HAN:
I'll get the information.

BEN:
All right then, we'll use your plan.

HAN:
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.

BEN:
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...

HAN:
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?

HAN:
Not bad.

BEN:
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.

HAN:
I'm not afraid of anything...

BEN:
Fear is their greatest weapon.

HAN:
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.

HAN:
This isn't a game, you know.

BEN:
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward largescale assault.

HAN:
Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.

BEN:
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...

HAN:
How much do you think she's talking about?

HAN:
I'm beginning not to like you.

BEN:
I think there are some things we should talk about.

HAN:
Who's going to pay me then?

BEN:
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.

HAN:
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.

BEN:
No, not anymore.

HAN:
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?

BEN:
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.

HAN:
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?

BEN:
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.

HAN:
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.

BEN:
The Empire must have gotten here first.

HAN:
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.

BEN:
Well, we'll see...

BEN:
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.

HAN:
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?

BEN:
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.

LUKE:
The Kiber Crystal.

LUKE:
I'm not going alone!

BEN:
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.

LUKE:
What about the princess?

LUKE:
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.

BEN:
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.

BEN:
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.

LUKE:
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.

BEN:
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...

LUKE:
I can't see!  How can I fight?

BEN:
I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.

LUKE:
You mean we should go after her!...

BEN:
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.

LUKE:
He can't find Organa Major.

BEN:
What is it?

BEN:
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.

LUKE:
What do I do?

BEN:
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.

LUKE:
Are you sure you don't need it?

BEN:
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.

LUKE:
Are you all right?

BEN:
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.

LUKE:
What's wrong?  What's happening?

BEN:
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...

LUKE:
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?

BEN:
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.

LUKE:
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?

BEN:
He's bluffing...

LUKE:
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?

BEN:
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.

LUKE:
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?

BEN:
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.

LUKE:
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.

BEN:
They use the Bogan Force.

LUKE:
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?

BEN:
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.

LUKE:
That's where my father was killed.

BEN:
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...

LUKE:
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?

BEN:
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.

LUKE:
How can you store an energy field within you?

BEN:
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.

LUKE:
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.

BEN:
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.

BEN:
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!

LUKE:
What do you mean?

BEN:
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.

LUKE:
Could I learn to feel it?

BEN:
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!

LUKE:
You mean I generate an energy field?

BEN:
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.

LUKE:
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...

BEN:
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.

BEN:
Not any more!

LUKE:
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!

BEN:
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.

LUKE:
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.

BEN:
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.

LUKE:
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.

BEN:
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?

LUKE:
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.

BEN:
You could put it that way.

LUKE:
You saw through me?

BEN:
I know that.

LUKE:
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.

LUKE:
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...

BEN:
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.

LUKE:
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.

BEN:
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.

BEN:
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.

LUKE:
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?

BEN:
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.

LUKE:
Who are you anyway?

LUKE:
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.

BEN:
Oh, so you're a warrior then?

LUKE:
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.

BEN:
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.

LUKE:
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!

BEN:
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.

BEN:
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?

LUKE:
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?

BEN:
Good morning!

BIGGS:
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.

LUKE:
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.

BIGGS:
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is downright amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force  go freelance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.

LUKE:
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?

BIGGS:
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...

LUKE:
But there was a lot of firing earlier...

BIGGS:
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!

LUKE:
You look great!  The uniform and everything!

BIGGS:
Of course, where you been kid?

BLUE LEADER:
Forget it, son.

LUKE:
Yes, sir, but I can get him...

BLUE LEADER:
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?

BLUE LEADER:
What's that?

LUKE:
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.

LUKE:
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.

BLUE LEADER:
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?

LUKE:
Yes, sir.

BLUE LEADER:
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.

LUKE:
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T2.

BLUE LEADER:
Have you been checked out?

LUKE:
Yes, sir.

BLUE LEADER:
You're Starkiller?

CONTROLLER:
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.

COMMANDER:
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.

COMMANDER:
Send one squad up.

CONTROLLER:
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.

COMMANDER:
I'll make a report later.

CONTROLLER:
Should we alert the Sith Lords?

COMMANDER:
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.

CONTROLLER:
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twentyseven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.

LEIA:
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?

HAN:
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.

HAN:
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.

LEIA:
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.

LEIA:
Did it occur to you they might find us?

HAN:
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.

HAN:
I'd better go see how he's doing.

LEIA:
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.

HAN:
Where are you taking us now anyway?

LEIA:
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.

LEIA:
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.

HAN:
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?

LEIA:
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.

HAN:
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.

LEIA:
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.

HAN:
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F888 Cargo Trawler.

LEIA:
There are only three or four left.

HAN:
Was this trip really necessary?

LEIA:
Here come six more... grid two!

LEIA:
It could be worse...

HAN:
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!

LEIA:
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.

LUKE:
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.

HAN:
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.

HAN:
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.

LUKE:
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...

HAN:
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.

LUKE:
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.

HAN:
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.

LUKE:
Come back here... Where are you going?

HAN:
Get to the ship!

HAN:
Move out of the way!

LUKE:
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!

LUKE:
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.

HAN:
Watch it!  Move back.

HAN:
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.

LUKE:
Is he afraid of the water?

HAN:
Not if this tunnel deadends.

LUKE:
I think she's going to be all right.

LUKE:
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...

HAN:
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.

LUKE:
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...

HAN:
I think I did.

LUKE:
Why didn't you say so before.

HAN:
This isn't going to work.

HAN:
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.

LUKE:
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.

LUKE:
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.

HAN:
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?

LUKE:
Well, I practice a lot...

HAN:
Don't you believe it.

LUKE:
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.

HAN:
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!

HAN:
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.

LUKE:
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.

HAN:
Why?

LUKE:
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...

LUKE:
What are you saying?

HAN:
I found it... It's just not there.

HAN:
Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.

LUKE:
You don't believe in the Force?

HAN:
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.

HAN:
It's automatic.

LUKE:
Who's the pilot?

LUKE:
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.

HAN:
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.

LUKE:
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.

HAN:
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.

INTERCOM VOICE:
Who is this?  What's your operating...

LUKE:
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.

INTERCOM VOICE:
With four casualties?!

LUKE:
No need, everything's under control.
