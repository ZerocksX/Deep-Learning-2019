EMPEROR:
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.

VADER:
I have felt it.

EMPEROR:
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.

VADER:
What is thy bidding, My Master?

HAN:
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.

RIEEKAN:
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.

HAN:
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.

RIEEKAN:
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.

HAN:
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.

RIEEKAN:
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.

HAN:
That's right.

HAN:
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.

RIEEKAN:
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

HAN:
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.

RIEEKAN:
Good, and Commander Skywalker?

HAN:
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
